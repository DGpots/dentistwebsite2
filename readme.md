# BMP Dental Website

This project uses the Tailwind CLI to provide a simple website for **BMP Dental**, the practice of **Dr. Bela Patel, D.D.S.** located in Plano, Texas.

## Usage

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build or watch the CSS file:

```bash
# Build once
npm run build

# Watch for changes
npm run watch
```

This will watch the `src/input.css` file and build it to `css/style.css`, which will be your final CSS file.

## Local development server

To preview the site while working on it, you can start a lightweight static server:

```bash
npm start
```

This serves the project locally at <http://localhost:3000> (or the next available port) so you can see your progress in the browser.
